Once they reach a certain number of saves they will be promoted to the next rank. The promotion will cause them to gain 1 attack point and one defence point

On invader stats, video description (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJCtRCyfVww):
-The larger number in the attack strength colum, from 7 to 19, does not actually factor directly into your fighting. That is explained in the instructions.
-The damage you deal is actually the sum of the number in parenthesis in that column, the dice roll (1-20), and any weapon bonus you have, minus the enemies defense.
-In missions 1-5, the different attackers have different attack and defense stats from each other. It is smart to target the ones with weakest defense first, or if they have the same, the one with strongest attack first.
- In missions 6+, the basic attackers all have identical stats so just try to defeat the ones that may be ganging up on a single troop of yours.

- You want to start with a good troop. Make a sum of the Attack Strength and Defence Strength of your pets. The ideal troop will have them on the rage of 56 and 53 (or more).
- Health. Maximizes at 18 (21 at second wave).
-  Goes up to 19 on Second Wave. Your bonus will increase on the following moments:
0 – 7/9
1 – 9/11
2 – 12/14
3 – 15/17
4 – 18
5 – 19

Hitpoints - The amount of life a soldier has. Max = 21.
Attack - The strength of the soldier. Max = 19
Enemy troop's stats may exceed the maximum of your troop's but they cannot weild weapons.

When you start the game check the stats of these characters, the Meohog and Techo should have a strength equal or above 8, if not restart the game until you get similar stats, the higher you get the better.

Mission 6
- Note the Meohogs are stronger than when you first faced them, so don't take them lightly but you should start by converting the Meohogs and then the buzzes, when you reach them you'll see why.

Mission 8
- Mission 8 was the toughest for me, these Grarrls have high attack and low defence

Mission 9
- Mission 9 is easy just very very long, the Grarrls are back but don't hit nearly as often, however their defence has gotten boosted, shame.

In particular, the Moehog's and Techo's attack strength should at least be 8 and 9 respectively.

---MAKE SURE THAT YOUR MOEHOG AND TECHO HAVE 8 AND 9 STRENGTH POINTS!

    - Moehog
    -- Attack = 8
    -- Defence = 11
    -- Health = 16

    - Skeith
    -- Attack = 18 (+4)
    -- Defence = 10
    -- Health = 18

    - Techo
    -- Attack = 9(+1)
    -- Defence = 11
    -- Health = 18

    - Scorchio
    -- Attack = 13(+2)
    -- Defence = 12
    -- Health = 15

    - Grundo
    -- Attack = 14(+2)
    -- Defence = 14
    -- Health = 18

HEALTH: This obviously determines whether you live or die!
---During the First Wave (Missions 1-5) your troops can have a maximum of 18 points.
---During the Second Wave (Missions 6-10) your troops can have a maximum of 21 points.

STRENGTH AND DEFENSE: This determines how hard you hit your enemies, and vice versa.
---You can have a maximum of 18 strength and 14 defense points for each troop in the First Wave.
---You can have a maximum of 19 strength and 14 defense points for each troop in the Second Wave.

Ranking up grants +1 base attack and +1 base defense

First 5 missions are a breeze, second 5 are hard

When you make your army, look at the attack strength of the techo. It must be 9. If not, click 'delete' to get a new army. No other stats matter.

-In missions 1-5, the different attackers have different attack and defense stats from each other. It is smart to target the ones with weakest defense first, or if they have the same, the one with strongest attack first.
- In missions 6+, the basic attackers all have identical stats so just try to defeat the ones that may be ganging up on a single troop of yours.


--Mission Five--
Not much new here, just keep doing what you've been doing. If you can beat this, you'll get a runner up medal and missions 6 and 7 should actually be a bit easier, but take a tad longer.


--Mission 6--
-Don't be scared off by the buzz's stats. They don't seem to be able to attack you much at all. The defence is true, however. Kill off all the grundos first (oops, *save) and then bring out your grundo to attack the buzzes with the skeith and techo.
