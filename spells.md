# General

Halberd
- Allows bearer to have 5 moves per turn. (However, skeith teleport locks skeith out from any additional moves)

# Grundo

Magic Force Spell
- Is 'earlier' healing item
- Heals a targeted ally
- Requires both Grundo and target have an available move
- Grundo cannot heal self
- Exact amount healed is unknown. No guides specify numbers, and youtube videos unfortunately cropped out the numbers.
- Java clone heals for 50% of the Grundo's attack value.
- We will use Java clone's value of 50% of the Grundo's attack value.

Magic Lightning Spell
- Is 'upgraded' healer item, better than Magic Force spell
- Heals all allies in the same (vertical) column as the ally you target, but costs 1 turn per ally healed.
- Requires both Grundo and target have an available move
- Grundo cannot heal self (even if in target column)
- In relationship to Magic Force Spell, one guide notes that THIS item has increased healing power but decreased attack bonus.
- Java clone uses same logic for healing amount on this item, 1/2 of the Grundo's attack value.
- However... this item's heal all allies in same column is not an 'upgrade' but rather a 'downgrade', as it still costs 1 turn per heal. Additionally, this item has 1 less attack. Those factors, combined with the fact that one guide notes it has increased healing power, makes me believe it should have a higher healing amount.
- Based on that, we will make this heal for 100% of Grundo's attack value so it is an actual improvement.
- Additionally, this spell allows a Grundo to attack a unit 2 spaces away (like Scorchio's bow)

When a unit is healed...
- Top of page displays: "Zap!!!<br><br>You've moved 2 out of 5"

# Skeith

Amulet of Teleportation
- Allows teleporting once per turn.
- Cannot teleport if enchanted.
- If Skeith is not holding Berserker_Battleaxe, then teleporting consumes ALL of Skeith's moves for the turn.
- Can teleport to any row except top 3 rows (put another way, can teleport to bottom 7 rows) that is unoccupied.
- Top of page displays: "Teleported!<br>You've moved 1 out of 5"

# Techo
Sword of Deflection
- Breaks enchantments on Skeiths, consumes a move, similar to healing by a grundo
- Top of page displays: "Woosh!!! Enchantment banished!<br><br><br>You've moved 1 out of 5"

# Moehog
Counter Enchantment Helmet
- Breaks enchantments on Grundos, consumes a move, similar to healing by a grundo
- Top of page displays: "Woosh!!! Enchantment banished!<br><br><br>You've moved 1 out of 5"

# Buzz/Grarrl
- Can enchant both grundo AND skeith (guide confirms both can cast either enchantment)
- String battlelog=a.name+" seals "+d.name+"'s ability to teleport!";
- String battlelog=a.name+" seals "+d.name+"'s ability to heal!";
- Java clone has both casting both spells, equally, with a 1 in 2 chance of each invader casting a spell on a given turn.
- I feel like the 1 in 2 chance is too frequent.
- Demeanor's guide confirms that Buzz can cast both spells

# Scorchio
- can attack two spaces away with Bow (rangedatk)
- Equip this to your Scorchio; once he reaches the rank of Soldier he can shoot his bow from 2 spaces away to attack.


As you pick up certain items they will enable your soldiers to perform specific abilities; for example, your Grundo can gain the ability to cast healing spells on your other soldiers (I'll explain how later). To use this ability both your Grundo and the recipient of the spell will need to have a move free, that is, neither of them should have a red border. First you click on the Grundo to highlight it, then click on the soldier you want to cast the spell on. The board will refresh and the recipient will have regained a portion of their health. This will count as both soldiers having moved, so if you cast healing spells on two of your soldiers then that would count as two moves for your Grundo and he will then have a red border.

In later Missions your enemies will gain the ability to cast spells which prevent your Grundo from healing and your Skeith from teleporting. To break the spell on your Grundo you will need to equip your Moehog with the Counter Enchantment Helmet, then click on your Moehog to select him and then on your Grundo to release him. For freeing your Skeith you will need to equip your Techo with the Sword of Deflection and do the same thing. As with healing, this process requires both soldiers to have a spare move, so it is best to do this at the start of your turn.

Any enchantments cast on your Grundo or Skeith will carry over from one Battle to the next, so make sure you break them before finishing off the last invader otherwise you'll have to waste a turn at the start of the next Battle.

Your Moehog should have been equipped with the Counter Enchantment Helmet from the previous Mission, so if your Grundo is being enchanted and you need it to heal the other fighters, just click on your Moehog then on your Grundo to break the enchantment. Similarly, it is not necessary for your Techo to break the enchantment for your Skeith unless your Skeith needs to be teleported to another square. However, do remember to break all enchantments on your Grundo and Skeith before converting the last invader, as the enchantments will be carried forward to the next Battle/Mission and you would have to waste a turn to break these enchantments in the new Battle/Mission.
