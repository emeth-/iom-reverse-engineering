SPAWN PETS:

max health = 18
max defense = 14
max strength = 18
minimum strength is maybe 7?
- You want to start with a good troop. Make a sum of the Attack Strength and Defence Strength of your pets. The ideal troop will have them on the rage of 56 and 53 (or more).

JAVA CLONE:
    - Moehog
    -- Attack = 8,9,10,11,12
    -- Defence = 8,9,10,11,12
    -- Health = 15,16,17,18

    - Skeith
    -- Attack = 15,16,17,18
    -- Defence = 8,9,10,11,12
    -- Health = 15,16,17,18

    - Techo
    -- Attack = 8,9,10,11,12
    -- Defence = 8,9,10,11,12
    -- Health = 15,16,17,18

    - Scorchio
    -- Attack = 10,11,12,13,14
    -- Defence = 8,9,10,11,12
    -- Health = 15,16,17,18

    - Grundo
    -- Attack = 10,11,12,13,14
    -- Defence = 8,9,10,11,12
    -- Health = 15,16,17,18

GUIDE SCREENSHOTS + TEXT
    - Moehog
    -- Attack = 7,8 (recommends equal or above 8)
    -- Defence = 9,10,11
    -- Health = 16

    - Skeith
    -- Attack = 15,16,17,18
    -- Defence = 8,9,10
    -- Health = 17,18

    - Techo
    -- Attack = 7,8,9 (recommends equal or above 8; recommends 9)
    -- Defence = 10,11,12
    -- Health = 14,18

    - Scorchio
    -- Attack = 11,12,13
    -- Defence = 10,11,12
    -- Health = 15,16

    - Grundo
    -- Attack = 12,13,14
    -- Defence = 11,12,13,14
    -- Health = 15,18




Final:
    - Moehog
    -- Attack = 7-9 (guides recommend getting a minimum value of 8 here... which implies it could go lower than 8. Java clone has 8,9,10,11,12 as the range. If we shift back 1, it would be 7-11. Guides really don't show values that high for Moehog... let's max it at 9, so 7-9 as the range.)
    -- Defence = 9,10,11 (screenshots only show values 9,10,11. That's within the range of Java's 8-12. Let's stick with the smaller range.)
    -- Health = 15,16,17,18 (only screenshot we have it health 16. Let's stick with Java clone's values for all health here)

    - Skeith
    -- Attack = 15,16,17,18 (screenshots show the exact same range as java-clone, so let's use it)
    -- Defence = 8,9,10,11,12 (screenshots show 8-10 solely, java clone shows 8-12. I think java clone's values are reasonable.)
    -- Health = 15,16,17,18

    - Techo
    -- Attack = 7,8,9,10,11 (Java clone shows 8-12. guide recommends equal or above 8; recommends 9. Based on that, feels like this should go down to 7. Range feels way too high. We'll stick with 7-11 for now.)
    -- Defence = 10,11,12 (Java clone shows 8-12. Screenshots show 10-12. Let's stick with these higher base values.)
    -- Health = 15,16,17,18

    - Scorchio
    -- Attack = 11,12,13 (Java clone shows 10-14, screenshots show 11-13. Let's trim the range to just capture the valid values from screenshots)
    -- Defence = 10,11,12 (Java clone shows 8-12, screenshots show 10-12. Let's do 10-12)
    -- Health = 15,16,17,18

    - Grundo
    -- Attack = 12,13,14 (12,13,14) (Java clone shows 10-14, screenshots show 12-14. Let's do 12-14)
    -- Defence = 11,12,13,14 (11,12,13,14) (Java clone shows 8-12, screenshots show 11-14 - so java clone is way off. Let's do 11-14)
    -- Health = 15,16,17,18

Note that the above numbers match this metric from a guide as well:
"- You want to start with a good troop. Make a sum of the Attack Strength and Defence Strength of your pets. The ideal troop will have them on the rage of 56 and 53 (or more)."

With the above metrics, it's possible for attack to be about 4 short, and defense to be about 5 short.
