---BEFORE YOU START---
First of all, read the instructions, strategy guide, and lost items links found at the main page (http://www.neopets.com/games/iom/inde...).

The rules let you know that your own troops can be converted back to your own team later if you lose them, but then they will lose all items and statistic bonuses, so you do not want this to happen.

--Mission One--
When you make your army, look at the attack strength of the techo. It must be 9. If not, click 'delete' to get a new army. No other stats matter.

Name your troops something you will recognize, so you can know which one is being attack. Whether you want to just go with Moehog, Skeith, etc. or give them actual names is up to you.

If you look underneath the board, it shows you how many squares per turn each species can move.
If you click on the icons of the weapons/potions, info about them will come up. Many weapons give bonus effects to a certain species. Some are only a couple more stats, but others give special powers.

-PLACING YOUR TROOPS-
-First off, your placement for missions 1 and 2 will be a bit different from the rest of the game.
- You generally want to put your troops on the first row above the highest village.
- If any enemy is on a tile adjacent to you (including diagonal), he will not advance past UNLESS he is also adjacent to a village. This is why you are 1 row higher than the villages.
- For spreading your troops, a single troop can cover up to 3 tiles if necessary. Use any mountains to your advantage as you don't need to cover those tiles.
- I generally have all my troops on the same row. This is not absolutely necessary but makes things easier. The only exception I've noticed is if you are teleporting your skeith, you cannot teleport onto an item so if it is blocking your way you will go one row higher. (Teleporting will come up in mission two, don't worry about it yet.)
- Try to get attack and defense weapons for your troops while you get there.

-BATTLING -
By the time your troops are all lined up, there will probably be 1 or 2 enemies that you can attack.

-The larger number in the attack strength colum, from 7 to 19, does not actually factor directly into your fighting. That is explained in the instructions.
-The damage you deal is actually the sum of the number in parenthesis in that column, the dice roll (1-20), and any weapon bonus you have, minus the enemies defense.
-In missions 1-5, the different attackers have different attack and defense stats from each other. It is smart to target the ones with weakest defense first, or if they have the same, the one with strongest attack first.
- In missions 6+, the basic attackers all have identical stats so just try to defeat the ones that may be ganging up on a single troop of yours.
-In the columns on the right, you will see a tally of how many each one of your troops has defeated. This is a pleasant game, so it is a SAVE count, not a KILL count. =)

-RANKING UP-

-At certain milestones of saves, your troops will rank up. This means they get a +1 to both attack and defense. (But there are maximums to how high those stats can be, so one or both may not actually be affected.)
-Once you rank up during a mission, no more saves will be counted in that troop's tally until the next mission.
-Since the first milestone is 3 saves, it only makes sense to level up each of your troops in mission 1 as there are 15 enemies in this mission, exactly enough. This is not necessary, however. Do make sure that your techo, and preferably scorchio, level up though.
-Please don't let any person or guide convince you to "max out" in every mission. This means spending hours purposely letting your own troops die and then saving them again. It really serves no statistical bonus, except a minor one for your moehog.

-LOST ITEMS-

-Getting the lost item gives the same bonus as leveling up, except to EVERY one of your troops. You want to make sure you get these.
-If you restart a mission after you pick up the item, you lose the bonus and you CANNOT get it back.
-For this cause, you do not want to pick up the lost item until battle 3 of every mission, once you know you will win.
-MAKE SURE you pick it up while there are still at least 2 enemies on the board, because it disappears and is lost forever when only 1 enemy is left.

-CLEANING UP-

-After you win a battle, you will be asked to delete enough troops so that you are back to only 5.
-You might be tempted to keep one of your new troops, but you want to stick with your original 5.
-Each species has its own specialties. Technically your scorchio is expendable but picking up a new troop would be too weak.
- Make sure you click remove selected, and NOT delete your entire army. :P


My apologies, but due to the text limit, Mission 2 and 3 info is found in the description of part 2.

---MISSION 2---
-Items you will be seeing in this mission: Bow and Amulet of Teleportation
- The bow allows the scorchio to attack an enemy 2 squares away once he has 9 saves.
- The amulet allows the skeith to teleport. Very useful, considering he only has 1 move available otherwise.
- You will see I had VERY lucky placement with these two items. However, if your placement is not satisfactory, you can choose to repeatedly click end turn so that your mission restarts IF YOU ARE ON BATTLE ONE. This will generate a new board for you, no harm done.

-MAKE SURE your techo has 9 saves before the mission is over. Also get some saves for your scorchio so you can try out that bow.

---MISSION THREE---
-Important item: Magic Force Spell for your grundo. This item makes your life incredibly better. If you click on your grundo, then click on one of your own troops, it will restore some health.
There is also a nifty +5 defence helmet for your moehog, or a decent +3 for any other species.

**Now that your grundo is a healer, you no longer need to bring him out to battle.
I will mention the changes to spacing in the next section.

*** Make sure you try to concentrate most of your saves with your techo. It will pay off later, even though it may not have the strongest attack now.

---NEW SPACING STRATEGY---
This is the spacing that you will be using for the rest of the game:
-Teleport the skeith to fill up the farthest right squares.
-Set up your scorchio to his left. Might be directly, might be 2 squares between.
- Set up your moehog and techo on the left half.
-The moehog is basically just a punchbag that you stick on the farthest left so that the techo doesn't get bombarded.

---Mission 4---
Items: Counter enchantment helmet and Berserker Batleaxe
-The helmet needs to be picked up by your moehog. In missions 6 and beyond, special enemies can prevent your grundo from healing. This helmet will fix that.
-The battleaxe provides +5 attack for anyone, quite nice.
However, when the skeith has it it allows him to move or attack once after teleporting, in the same turn.
Once again, be trying to get as many saves as possible with your techo.

*Sorry that you can't see the full screen to know when I heal, but just be aware if a certain troop is being attacked by more than one enemy, and how much damage he can be dealt.

--Mission Five--

Not much new here, just keep doing what you've been doing. If you can beat this, you'll get a runner up medal and missions 6 and 7 should actually be a bit easier, but take a tad longer.

--Mission 6--
-Make sure to grab a sword of deflection for your techo. Not only is it the strongest game in the weapon (+6) but also wards off a negative spell on your skeith.
-Don't be scared off by the buzz's stats. They don't seem to be able to attack you much at all. The defence is true, however. Kill off all the grundos first (oops, *save) and then bring out your grundo to attack the buzzes with the skeith and techo.

(Information beyond this not shown in video)

--Mission 7--
Halberd. Don't pick it up.

--Mission 8--
Get the new healer for your grundo. It packs a much nicer heal. However, there is one catch. It heals every friendly person in the same vertical column as the troop you select and takes as many moves as the troops it heals. So just try to keep any saved invaders away from accidental healing.

Also, although the healing power is increased, the attack bonus is decreased by one. This means you no longer need to bring him out to fight the stronger invaders at the end. Just use your scorchio.
--Missions 9 & 10--
Really boring, don't pass out and you'll be fine. Congratulations.
