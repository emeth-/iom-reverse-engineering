<h1>RQ'S [Invasion of Meridell] GUIDE</h1>
</center>

<h3>Follow the Moehogs to victory!</h3>
This guide is split into 4 major sections.
<p>3 of them describe the game and how to play:
<br>---<b>Starting Off</b> (which introduces beginners to the game)
<br>---<b>The Board</b> (which shows you the basic layout of the game)
<br>---<b>Playing</b> (which instructs you on the who/what/when/where/why/how to move)
</p>
<p>The last is the most important - if you read nothing else, read this!:
<br>---<b>Mission Guide</b> (which takes you through each Mission separately)
</p>
<p>&amp; of course, please feel free to <a href="http://www.neopets.com/neomessages.phtml?type=send">neomail</a> me with any question, anytime at all. (:


<br><br></p>
<center><h2>[STARTING OFF]</h2></center>
<h3>Read the preliminary pages!</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.neopets.com/games/iom/index.phtml">MAIN PAGE</a>: Here you are introduced to the game and see the 4 possible trophies that you can win.
<br>---Everyone receives the medal for completing Mission 5 Battle 3 at any time.
<br>---You can also receive an avatar for completing Mission 7 Battle 3 <b>within the same month</b> that you started!
<br>---(Note: If you have played the game before, please be sure to delete your army before trying for the avatar.)
<br>---(The same applies for trying for a 1st-3rd place trophy.)
<br><img src="./demeanours got their homepage at Neopets.com_files/ibi4b8.jpg"><br></p>
<p><a href="http://www.neopets.com/games/iom/i_of_m_inst.phtml">INSTRUCTIONS</a>: Here you can see the rules. Pay particular attention to 'conversions' in the <b>How you lose</b> section!
<br>---You WILL be using this to your advantage; be patient and I'll explain later. (:
<br><img src="./demeanours got their homepage at Neopets.com_files/hvz5fb.jpg"></p>
<p><a href="http://www.neopets.com/games/iom/i_of_m_inst2.phtml">STRATEGY GUIDE</a>: Here there is information to help you in your game. Skim through it for now.
<br>---I will be REFERING BACK TO the <b>Rank and Saves</b> section!
<br>---Gaining ranks will help you maximize your strength boost, giving you a better chance of hitting your enemy.
<br><img src="./demeanours got their homepage at Neopets.com_files/2n67rm8.jpg"></p>
<p><a href="http://www.neopets.com/games/iom/i_of_m_inst3.phtml">LOST ITEMS</a>: Here you are assigned another task, which unlocks a fabulous opportunity!
<br>---Basically, you get better attack/defense statistics for retrieving the lost item without failing the mission.
<br><img src="./demeanours got their homepage at Neopets.com_files/a0b435.jpg"></p>
<p><a href="http://www.neopets.com/games/iom/i_of_m_start_v2.phtml">PLAY(ers)</a>: Here you see your army!
<br>---Start by removing your pre-existing army by pressing 'delete' at the bottom of the page.
<br>---Keep doing this until your army's attack and defense statistics are similar to mine below.
<br>---<b>MAKE SURE THAT YOUR MOEHOG AND TECHO HAVE 8 AND 9 STRENGTH POINTS!</b>
<br>---Also make sure that everyone has good defense.
<br>---RENAME your troops (as I already have) so that you will be able to distinguish them from converted troops later.
<br>---Continue on to Mission 1 Battle 1
<br><img src="./demeanours got their homepage at Neopets.com_files/242bho6.jpg"><br><br></p>
<center><h2>[THE BOARD]</h2></center>
<h3>Start the game; understand it!</h3>
GENERAL SET-UP: Here you see your starting position including villages and mountains, and items on the board (left)
<br>&amp; troops' name, rank, health, strength and defense boosts, weapons, and saves (right).
<br>---There is a total of 10 Missions. Each Mission is composed of 3 Battles (for a total of 30 Battles).
<br><img src="./demeanours got their homepage at Neopets.com_files/2r56i2t.jpg"><p>STARTING POSITION: Generally, your troops start at the bottom of the map; your enemies at the top.
<br>---Many mountains are strewn randomly about the board - these are obstacles that you and your enemy cannot walk over.
<br>---Your villages are in the bottom half of the board and serve as obstacles to your troops and targets to your enemies.

</p>
<p>ITEMS ON THE BOARD: Each Battle, you will see two types of one-use items on the board.
<br>---These are the lost item and health potions.
<br>---Click the icons at the bottom of the page if you want to view their information.
<br>---Wait to collect the lost item until you are on Battle 3 of each Mission.
<br>---Use the health potions as needed to heal your troops, but never allow your enemy to pass!

</p>
<p>HEALTH: This obviously determines whether you live or die!
<br>---During the First Wave (Missions 1-5) your troops can have a maximum of 18 points.
<br>---During the Second Wave (Missions 6-10) your troops can have a maximum of 21 points.
<br>---Watch your enemies health too! It is best to hit the enemy with the least amount of health to kill your enemies quickly.

</p>
<p>STRENGTH AND DEFENSE: This determines how hard you hit your enemies, and vice versa.
<br>---You can have a maximum of 18 strength and 14 defense points for each troop in the First Wave.
<br>---You can have a maximum of 19 strength and 14 defense points for each troop in the Second Wave.

</p>
<p>WEAPONS: There are also two types of items that your troops can equip (attack and defense items)!
<br>---Always get the best items that you can for each of your troops!
<br>---Pick up a weapon or defense item by moving your troop onto its square.
<br>---If you already have an item equipped and step on another, you will drop your item to pick up the new one.
<br>---Pay special attention to items that have special species-specific bonuses.
<br>---Follow the <b>Mission Guide</b> below to see which items you will need to continue successfully!

</p>
<p>SAVES: These determine your rank!
<br>---For each enemy that you kill, the troop that killed it will receive one save.
<br>---Accumulating saves to get to a higher rank gives your troop one more more strength and defense point.
<br>---YOU WILL WANT TO GAIN ONE RANK EACH MISSION!

</p>
<p>RANKS: Remember that chart? ;)
<br>---<b>To gain ranks you MUST convert your new troops</b> (enemies that you've just killed) <b>back into enemies to kill them again.</b>
<br>---To do so: kill all but one enemy, place a new troop on top/north of him and hit <b>End Turn</b> until he is converted into an enemy.
<br>---DO NOT accidentally kill one of your main five troops.
<br>---Kill one of the enemies and repeat.
<br>---See the <b>Ranking Up</b> section below.



<br><br></p>
<center><h2>[PLAYING]</h2></center>

<h3>Let the fun begin!</h3>

<p>MAIN PAGE: Move your troops to THIS ROW (shown below) so that your enemies cannot reach the villages.
<br>---Move by clicking on your troop and then a neighboring space - you can go up, down, to either side, or diagonally.
<br>---Each troop can only move a limited number of times, shown below the map, and turn red when they can no longer move.
<br>---You can have a gap of up to two blocks between your troops without letting the enemy through except for on the extreme sides.
<br>---From here, start attacking your enemies by clicking on your troop and then the enemy.
<br>---Remember, it is always best to attack the WEAKEST enemy first!
<br><img src="./demeanours got their homepage at Neopets.com_files/5nrzie.jpg"></p>
<p>DAMAGE CHART: This is the mechanism which calculates how much damage you do to your enemies.
<br>---Basically, you roll a random number 1-20, which gets added to your attack strength and item boost to produce a strike.
<br>---The enemy's defense boost blocks some of your strike, leaving you with either:
<br>-----A miss (0 damage).
<br>-----A hit (1+ damage).
<br>---A hit is subtracted from your enemy's health until it goes to or past 0.
<br>---When your enemy reaches that point it will be converted into a new, harmless troop for you to use or... most likely... ignore.
<br><img src="./demeanours got their homepage at Neopets.com_files/2mrbo1x.jpg"></p>
<p>FINISHING THE BATTLE/MISSION: After you defeat all of your enemies, you have to re-select your troops.
<br>---<b>Remember to rank-up all of your troops before ending the Mission (Battle 3)!</b>
<br>---<b>If you lose any of your original five troops, you must forfeit that Mission by hitting End Turn until you die.</b>
<br>---(Don't worry! You will only have to restart your current Mission, not the entire game.)
<br>---Keep your original five troops by leaving their check-boxes blank (remember, you need their accumulated saves and weapons).
<br>---Delete your new, useless troops by checking them and pressing <b>Remove</b> at the bottom of the page.
<br><img src="./demeanours got their homepage at Neopets.com_files/2rw9jra.jpg"></p>
<p>LOST ITEM: Get this at the end of Battle 3 of each Mission.
<br>---Stop once you kill ALL BUT TWO or three of your enemies.
<br>---(Once you only have one enemy left, the Lost Item disappears for that Battle...
<br>---If that Battle is your last, you will not be able to get the Item for that Mission.)
<br>---Move one troop up to the top of the board to retrieve the Lost Item to earn your troops each +1 strength and defense point.
<br>---You /can/ get the Lost Item before Battle 3, but I would not recommend it... because:
<br>---If you lose the Mission after you get the Item, you will keep the Item but LOSE its strength and defense bonus.
<br><img src="./demeanours got their homepage at Neopets.com_files/28v39qf.jpg"></p>
<p>RANKING UP: During Battle 3 of the first 5 Missions you must rank up! To do so:
<br>---Kill all but one enemy, place one of your new troops on top/north of him and hit <b>End turn</b> until he is converted into an enemy.
<br>---DO NOT accidentally let one of your main five troops die during the wait
<br>---Kill one of the enemies and repeat.
<br>---Below you see the order in which the enemy will attack its surroundings.
<br>---Cluster your troops around the enemies and new troop so that they can all reach them to get saves.
<br>---If someone in your troop is low on health, make sure you have someone else at a lower number than him so he won't be hit!
<br>---(#1 below is the converted troop that I'm repeatedly killing off.)
<br><img src="./demeanours got their homepage at Neopets.com_files/2hmq2h5.jpg"></p>
<p>BACKING UP YOUR TROOPS: Protect your troops when they are low on health!
<br>---As shown above, your enemy will first attack the troop on top/north of him, then progress through the rest of the numbers.
<br>---Thus, you can place converted troops on top/north of your enemies to prevent your main troops from dying.
<br>---Remember that you must still heal your troops using potions or the Scroll!

<br><br></p>
<center><h2>[MISSION GUIDE]</h2></center>

<h3>Strategy, strategy, strategy!</h3>
<p><b>Don't worry, the long part of this guide is over. :P</b>
<br>Now that you really know the game, you can use this section as a quick reference for each Mission.
<br>The weapons I TELL you to get, you MUST get. Other than that, the ones shown are just the best you can get by that time.
</p>
<p><b><br>BEFORE STARTING: MAKE SURE THAT YOUR MOEHOG AND TECHO HAVE 8 AND 9 STRENGTH POINTS!</b>


</p>
<p>MISSION ONE
<br>SET-UP: Move your troops to the usual row.
<br><img src="./demeanours got their homepage at Neopets.com_files/313k2nr.jpg"><br>GOALS: Get everyone items; 3 saves each.
<br>---Let each troop kill one enemy in each Battle so that they each have 3 saves by the end of the Mission.
<br><img src="./demeanours got their homepage at Neopets.com_files/2uj6zc8.jpg"><br></p>
<p>MISSION TWO
<br>SET-UP: You need the Amulet to be within two spaces of your Skeith.
<br>---You can restart the Mission by hitting <b>End Turn</b> until your villages are sacked.
<br>---Do this until the Amulet is within reach, use it to teleport your Skeith somewhere to block the 6th enemy.
<br>---Continue to move your other troops up to the usual row to fight.
<br><img src="./demeanours got their homepage at Neopets.com_files/2qin5sy.jpg"><br>GOALS: Get your Scorchio the Bow; your Moehog, Techo, and Scorchio 9 saves each.
<br>---The Bow will let your Scorchio hit enemies from two spaces away once he's a Soldier.
<br>---Don't know how to rank up? REFER BACK TO THE <b>RANKING UP</b> SECTION.
<br><img src="./demeanours got their homepage at Neopets.com_files/29fxgnd.jpg"><br></p>
<p>MISSION THREE
<br>SET-UP: Teleport your Skeith in the middle of enemies 6 and 7's paths.
<br>---If there are mountains in your way, you must quickly move your Moehog up to help your Skeith's blocking.
<br>---Move everyone else BUT YOUR GRUNDO. (see below)
<br><img src="./demeanours got their homepage at Neopets.com_files/r2wcbl.jpg"><br>---Example of movement:
<br><img src="./demeanours got their homepage at Neopets.com_files/j9r147.jpg"><br>GOALS: Get your Grundo the Scroll; your Moehog and Techo 32 saves each.
<br>---The Scroll will let your Grundo heal other troops - click on your Grundo and then the hurt troop.
<br>---Keep in mind that your Grundo cannot heal himself! So keep him out of harm's way.
<br>---(Just let him hang out in the back near his starting position.)
<br><img src="./demeanours got their homepage at Neopets.com_files/28mmsz8.jpg"><br></p>
<p><b>SPECIAL TIP: HEAL OFTEN! It is not unusual for me to use 2 of my 5 turns healing, often several times in a row.</b>

<br></p>
<p>MISSION FOUR
<br>SET-UP: Teleport your Skeith up and quickly move your Moehog to block the 3 closest enemies.
<br>---Then move your Techo and Scorchio.
<br><img src="./demeanours got their homepage at Neopets.com_files/358791z.jpg"><br>GOALS: Get your Techo and Moehog 64 saves each.
<br><img src="./demeanours got their homepage at Neopets.com_files/33bfl83.jpg"><br></p>
<p>MISSION FIVE
<br>SET-UP: Same as before.
<br><img src="./demeanours got their homepage at Neopets.com_files/35kly7q.jpg"><br>GOALS: Get your Moehog the Helmet and 96 saves.
<br>---The Battleaxe is really strong! It will give your Skeith an extra turn after teleportation.
<br><img src="./demeanours got their homepage at Neopets.com_files/2qbg952.jpg"><br></p>
<p>MISSION SIX
<br>SET-UP: Same as before.
<br>---Save the Invader Buzzes for last - they're very tedious to kill!
<br>---They will also cast spells that immobilize (stop) your Skeith's and Grundo's abilities to teleport and heal.
<br>---You must use your Moehog's Helmet to free the Grundo and your Techo's Sword to free the Skeith.
<br>---Do so by clicking on one troop, then the other.
<br><img src="./demeanours got their homepage at Neopets.com_files/2n1ui5u.jpg"><br>GOALS: Get your Techo the Sword of Deflection!
<br><img src="./demeanours got their homepage at Neopets.com_files/2zsxumc.jpg"><br></p>
<p>MISSION SEVEN
<br>SET-UP: Like 2 Invader Buzzes weren't enough? Take 3.
<br>---Same as before.
<br><img src="./demeanours got their homepage at Neopets.com_files/1zq56cy.jpg"><br>GOALS: Race toward that avatar!
<br><img src="./demeanours got their homepage at Neopets.com_files/2zsxumc.jpg"><br><br></p>
