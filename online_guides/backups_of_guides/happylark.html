Hi guest! Need some tips for the <a>Invasion of Meridell</a> game? Or perhaps some help to obtain the medal and/or avatar? Hopefully this guide can help :)
<br><br><br><font color="red">Important note: If you want the avatar, you have to finish Mission 7 Battle 3 in the
SAME month you created the game. 
<br>To get the medal, you just have to finish Mission 5 Battle 3 and it doesn't matter when you created the game.
</font>
</center>
<br><br><br><hr><br><br><br><font size="6"></font><center><b>General Tips</b></center>
<br><br><table width="80%" border="2"><tbody><tr><td><br><font size="5"></font><center><b>Your army</b></center>
<br>
You start off with 5 fighters. Before starting the game, check the stats of your army, which should
look something like the one shown below. 
<br><br><center><img src="./attack_pattern_files/start.jpg"></center>
<br>
In particular, the Moehog's and Techo's attack strength
should at least be 8 and 9 respectively. If the stats are weak, just delete your troops until you are satisfied.
Name your fighters so that you can distinguish them from any converted invaders later.
<br><br>
In each battle, the converted invaders form part of your troops. However, you have to discard all but 5 fighters
before you continue with the next battle. It is recommended that you keep the original 5 that you started with as they
would have accumulated saves and items in each battle.
<br><br></td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><br><table width="80%" border="2"><tbody><tr><td><br><font size="5"></font><center><b>Moving around</b></center>
<br>
You can make up to 5 moves per turn. You can either use each move for a different fighter, or several moves for one or
more fighters. However, each species can only move a certain number of times per turn (unless they are equipped with
certain items).
As shown in the legend on the gameboard, you can make up to 4 moves per turn for the Moehog, 2 moves per turn for the Techo,
Scorchio and Grundo, and once per turn for the Skeith.
<br><br></td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><br><table width="80%" border="2"><tbody><tr><td><br><font size="5"></font><center><b>Stats</b></center>
<br>
(Note: First Wave refers to Mission 1-5 and Second Wave refers to Mission 6-10) 
<br><br><b>Health</b>
<br>
The maximum health of each fighter is 18 in the First Wave and 21 in the Second Wave.
If the health of a fighter is zero or less, it will be converted to an invader
and will attack your other fighters. Note that even if you convert it back
later, it will not regain any bonuses or items or saves that it has accumulated
in earlier battles. Similarly, an invader will be converted and becomes one of
your fighters when its health is zero or less (An exception is the Invader Buzz, which
just leaves behind a smoking crater <img src="./attack_pattern_files/Smoking_Crater.jpg" width="30" height="30">
when defeated).
<br><br><b>Attack Strength</b>
<br>
Each fighter can have a maximum base attack strength of 18 in the First Wave and 19 in the
Second Wave. Attack strength affects the chances of hitting an opponent as well
as the damage done to the opponent (this will be explained in more detail
later). The table below shows the bonuses for different levels of attack strength.
<br><br><table border="1"><tbody><tr><td><b>Attack Strength</b></td>
<td><b>Bonus</b></td>
</tr><tr><td>9-11 </td>
<td>1</td>
</tr><tr><td>12-14 </td>
<td>2</td>
</tr><tr><td>15-17 </td>
<td>3</td>
</tr><tr><td>18 </td>
<td>4</td>
</tr><tr><td>19 </td>
<td>5</td>
</tr></tbody></table><br>
In addition, if a fighter obtains an attack item, it will give the fighter an attack bonus on top of the bonuses mentioned
above. (Refer to the section on Items for more details) 
<br><br><b>Defence Strength</b>
<br>
The maximum base defence strength of each fighter is 14 for both Waves. Defence strength
affects how well a fighter can avoid damage when attacked. Unlike bonuses for
attack strength, defence bonuses
come entirely from the defence items obtained by a fighter.
<br><br></td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><br><table width="80%" border="2"><tbody><tr><td><br><font size="5"></font><center><b>Items</b></center>
<br>
Items can be found in each battle and you just have to move any fighter onto an
item to acquire it. However, as each fighter can only hold 1 attack item and 1
defence item, it will drop the current item that it is holding and obtain the
new item instead. All potions are consumed as soon as they are landed on. Do
also note that if an invader moves onto a square occupied by an item, that item
vanishes but the invader cannot make use of it.
<br><br>
Below are the various attack and defence items that you can find in Mission 1-7.
Certain items are "specialized" for certain species so extra bonuses
will be given to the particular species that hold these items.

<br>
Hopefully the following information will help you in predicting what the invaders might do next.
<br><br><b>Moves</b>
<br>
The invaders will move in a straight line towards your fighters and villages
unless there is a mountain in their path, in which case they will move
diagonally around it. When an invader reaches a square adjacent to a fighter, it
will stop moving and attack the fighter, unless there is also a village adjacent
to the invader. In this case, the invader will choose to sack the village first
and the only way to stop the invader from doing so is to convert it by the end
of your turn.
<br><br><b>Attacks</b>
<br>
The table below shows the priority of an invader when attacking a fighter. The
invader (I) will attack the fighter in a square with the lowest number.
<br><br><table border="1" width="150"><tbody><tr><td><p align="center">3</p></td>
<td><p align="center">1</p></td>
<td><p align="center">6</p></td>
</tr><tr><td><p align="center">4</p></td>
<td><p align="center"><b>I</b></p></td>
<td><p align="center">7</p></td>
</tr><tr><td><p align="center">5</p></td>
<td><p align="center">2</p></td>
<td><p align="center">8</p></td>
</tr></tbody></table><br><br>
Occasionally, an invader might have an alternative attacking priority as shown
in the table below. 
<br><br><table border="1" width="150"><tbody><tr><td><p align="center">8</p></td>
<td><p align="center">1</p></td>
<td><p align="center">3</p></td>
</tr><tr><td><p align="center">7</p></td>
<td><p align="center"><b>I</b></p></td>
<td><p align="center">4</p></td>
</tr><tr><td><p align="center">6</p></td>
<td><p align="center">2</p></td>
<td><p align="center">5</p></td>
</tr></tbody></table><br><br>
Thus, if a fighter is in danger of being converted, you can either
move that fighter away so that it is not adjacent to an invader, or you can move
another fighter to a square with a lower number so that the invader will attack
it instead.
<br><br></td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><br><table width="80%" border="2"><tbody><tr><td><br><font size="5"></font><center><b>Combat</b></center>
<br>
You can calculate the amount of damage a fighter can do to an invader using the
following equation:
<br><br><center><b>Attack Bonus â�&nbsp; Weapon Bonus â�&nbsp; Roll - Invader's Defence = Damage</b></center>
<br>
where Roll is a random number between 1-20.
<br><br>
For example, let's assume that a Skeith has an attack strength of 18 with no attack items
and it hits an invader with a defence strength of 8. If the roll is 19, the
amount of damage done to the invader will be 4 â�&nbsp; 0 â�&nbsp; 19 - 8 = 15. So if the
health of an invader is 15 or less, it will be converted. On the other hand, if
the roll is 3, the amount of damage done to the invader will be 4 â�&nbsp; 0 â�&nbsp; 3 - 8 =
-1. In this case, no damage will be done to the invader. 
<br><br>
Similarly, you can try to work out the maximum damage that an invader can do to
your fighter by assuming that the invader will roll a 20. If we assume that the
Skeith in the above example has a defence strength of 9 and the invader has an
attack strength of 9, the maximum amount of damage that can be done to the
Skeith will be 1 â�&nbsp; 0 â�&nbsp; 20 - 9 = 12 (note that invaders have no weapon bonuses).
Of course the invaders will not always roll 20s but the above would help in
calculating the probability of your fighters being converted.
<br><br></td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><br><table width="80%" border="2"><tbody><tr><td><br><font size="5"></font><center><b>Ranks and Saves</b></center>
<br>
All fighters start with the rank of Villager. If a fighter convert an invader, it is known as a save. When a
fighter has accumulated a certain number of saves, it will be promoted to the
next rank as shown in the table below. 
<br><br><table border="1"><tbody><tr><td><b>No. of saves</b></td>
<td><b>Rank</b></td>
</tr><tr><td>Less than 3 </td>
<td>Villager</td>
</tr><tr><td>3 </td>
<td>Defender</td>
</tr><tr><td>9 </td>
<td>Soldier</td>
</tr><tr><td>32 </td>
<td>Captain</td>
</tr><tr><td>64 </td>
<td>Lieutenant</td>
</tr><tr><td>96 </td>
<td>Corporal</td>
</tr></tbody></table><br>
When a fighter is promoted to the next rank, its attack and defence strength
will increase by 1 point. However, once a fighter is promoted in a particular
Battle, any saves made by that fighter during other Battles in the same Mission
will not accumulate. In effect, each fighter can only be promoted once per
Mission.
<br><br></td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><br><table width="80%" border="2"><tbody><tr><td><br><font size="5"></font><center><b><img src="./attack_pattern_files/Goblet.jpg"><img src="./attack_pattern_files/Gold_Ixi.jpg"><img src="./attack_pattern_files/Urn_of_Abundance.jpg"><img src="./attack_pattern_files/Ancient_Book.jpg"><img src="./attack_pattern_files/Crown.jpg">
							Lost Items</b>
							<img src="./attack_pattern_files/Royal_Plate.jpg"><img src="./attack_pattern_files/Royal_Tapestry.jpg"><img src="./attack_pattern_files/Treasure_Chest.jpg"><img src="./attack_pattern_files/Vase_of_Plenty.jpg"><img src="./attack_pattern_files/Orb.jpg"></center>
<br><br>
A "Lost Item" appears in every Mission and will exist for 3
Battles. If you recover it in the first Battle, it won't appear in the
next two Battles. If you don't recover it in the first Battle, it will
appear in the second Battle, and failing that, the third Battle. However,
if you haven't recovered it by the end of the third Battle, it is lost
forever but a different "Lost Item" will appear for the next
Mission. 
<br><br>
There are no penalties for failing to recover a "Lost Item", but
recovering it will boost the base attack and defence strength of all your
fighters by 1 point (up to the maximum levels). However, note that if you
lose a Battle, you would have to restart the Mission and the boost from
the "Lost Item" for that Mission will be lost. Furthermore, once
you recover a "Lost Item", it is saved forever and will never
reappear, no matter how many times you restart the Mission.
<br><br>
To summarize, you should only recover a "Lost Item" only if you are confident of
    completing the Mission. But do remember to recover the "Lost
    Items" while there are at least 2 invaders on the board, as it will
    disappear for the rest of the Battle when only 1 invader is left. 
<br><br></td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><br><hr><br><br><br><font size="6"></font><center><b>Strategy Guide</b></center>
<br><table width="80%"><tbody><tr><td><br>
Note: The following is just what I would normally do in each Mission. You can
either choose to follow it or use your own strategy. The items shown in the
examples may also differ from those in your game. 
<br></td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><table width="80%" border="2"><tbody><tr><td><br><font size="5"></font><center><b>Mission 1</b></center>
<br><br><center><img src="./attack_pattern_files/m1.jpg" width="395" height="414"></center>
<br><br>
The above shows an example of a Battle in Mission 1. Move each of your 5 fighters
in turn to Row 6, where Row 1 is the first row from the top. As the
mountains are in the way of the Techo, move it between Invader 01 and 02 as shown below, so that you can stop the third invader from
advancing and won't waste a potion.
<br><br><center><img src="./attack_pattern_files/m1_1.jpg" width="395" height="414"></center>
<br><br>
As mentioned before, if you are confident of completing the Mission, get the "Lost Item"
when there are 2 invaders left on the board. In addition, when there's
only 1 invader left, don't be in a hurry to convert it unless all your
fighters are in danger of being converted by the invader instead. Move
your fighters to get any weapons that are still lying around. 
<br><br><br>
Recommendations for Mission 1: 
<ul><li>Let each fighter make a save for each Battle
in the Mission so that all will be promoted to the rank of Defender by the
end of the Mission.
</li></ul><br></td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><br><table width="80%" border="2"><tbody><tr><td><br><font size="5"></font><center><b>Mission 2</b></center>
<br><br><center><img src="./attack_pattern_files/m2.jpg" width="395" height="414"></center>
<br><br>
In this Mission, Invader 05 is positioned much nearer to your villages
from the start. There should be 2 Amulets of Teleportation 
<img src="./attack_pattern_files/Amulet_of_Teleportation.jpg"> lying around
but if none of them are within 2 spaces of your Skeith, you can either
move your Techo 2 spaces per turn to stop the invader from advancing, or
keep clicking "End Turn Now" so that your villages will be
sacked and you can restart the Mission. Teleport your Skeith to Row 6 once
it gets an Amulet and start attacking Invader 06 when it is adjacent to
your Skeith, while moving your other fighters up to Row 6 as well. 
<br><br><br>
Recommendations for Mission 2: 
<ul><li>Let your Techo and Scorchio accumulate 9 saves
each by the end of the Mission so that they would be promoted to the rank
of Soldier. 
</li><li>Equip your Scorchio with a bow <img src="./attack_pattern_files/Bow.jpg">
if there are any in this Mission. 
</li></ul><br></td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><br><table width="80%" border="2"><tbody><tr><td><br><font size="5"></font><center><b>Mission 3</b></center>
<br><br><center><img src="./attack_pattern_files/m3.jpg" width="395" height="414"></center>
<br><br>
As usual, teleport your Skeith to Row 6 to stop Invaders 05 and 06 from
advancing. If your Scorchio has been promoted to the rank of Soldier and
has a bow from the previous Mission, it can now attack invaders from 2
spaces away. Move your Scorchio to the middle of Row 6 (that would be the
space below a mountain and between the 2 potions in the above example) so
that it can attack most of the invaders. At the same time, move your
Grundo to get the Magic Force Spell <img src="./attack_pattern_files/Magic_Force_Spell.jpg"> 
as soon as possible, while moving your Moehog and Techo up to Row 6 as well.
<br><br><br>
When your Grundo gets a Magic Force Spell, it can heal your other fighters
if both have an available move. Unfortunately, it is unable to heal itself
so move it away if any invaders are attacking it. You should always have
healing as your first priority, since your fighters won't be converted if
their health are restored. From Battle 2 onwards_  your Grundo need not be moved
as its main task is to heal your other fighters. This will in turn free up
a move for the other fighters to move up to Row 6 more quickly.
<br><br><br>
Recommendations for Mission 3: 
<ul><li>Let your Moehog and Skeith accumulate 9 saves
each by the end of the Mission so that they would be promoted to the rank
of Soldier.
</li></ul><br></td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><br><table width="80%" border="2"><tbody><tr><td><br><font size="5"></font><center><b>Mission 4</b></center>
<br><br><center><img src="./attack_pattern_files/m4.jpg" width="395" height="414"></center>
<br><br>
Teleport your Skeith to Row 6 to stop Invaders 05 and 06 from advancing.
Move your Scorchio to the middle of Row 6 (onto the Plate Armour), your
Techo diagonally up to Row 6 (onto the square between the 2 Magic Force
Spells), and your Moehog to Row 6 (onto the square below the mountain).
Use your Scorchio and Techo as your main fighters and your Grundo
to heal when necessary.
<br><br><br>
Recommendations for Mission 4: 
<ul><li>Let your Scorchio and Techo convert most of the invaders so that they would
be promoted to the rank of Captain by the end of Mission 5. 
</li></ul><br></td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><br><table width="80%" border="2"><tbody><tr><td><br><font size="5"></font><center><b>Mission 5</b></center>
<br><br><center><img src="./attack_pattern_files/m5.jpg" width="395" height="414"></center>
<br><br>
The above shows an example of Mission 5 after 2 rounds. It is actually
similar to Mission 4, except all the invaders are now Grundos instead of
Scorchios. Just follow the same strategy used in Mission 4. However, before you
convert the last invader, it is necessary to equip your Moehog with the
Counter Enchantment Helmet <img src="./attack_pattern_files/Counter_Enchantment_Helmet.jpg">
if you are going to continue with Mission 6.  
<br><br><br>
Recommendations for Mission 5: 
<ul><li>Let your Scorchio and Techo accumulate 32 saves by the end of the Mission so
that they would be promoted to the rank of Captain.
</li><li>Equip your Skeith, Techo or Moehog with the Berseker Battleaxe <img src="./attack_pattern_files/Berserker_Battleaxe.jpg">
if there are any in this Mission.  
</li></ul><br><br><br><center><b>Congratulations!!! You have earned a nice medal for your lookup! :)</b></center>

<br><br><center><img src="./attack_pattern_files/m6.jpg" width="395" height="414"></center>
<br><br>
Teleport your Skeith to Row 6 to stop Invaders 05 and 06 from advancing. Since
there is a Sword of Deflection <img src="./attack_pattern_files/Sword_of_Deflection.jpg">
in the middle of Row 6, move your Techo onto it to equip it, while moving your 
Moehog and Scorchio up to Row 6 as well. Concentrate on converting the invader 
Moehogs first as the invader Buzzes have a defence of 25 and are really tedious to convert. 
<br><br><br>
Your Moehog should have been equipped with the Counter Enchantment Helmet
from the previous Mission, so if your Grundo is being enchanted and you
need it to heal the other fighters, just click on your Moehog then on your
Grundo to break the enchantment. Similarly, it is not necessary for your Techo to
break the enchantment for your Skeith unless your Skeith needs to be
teleported to another square. However, do remember to break all
enchantments on your Grundo and Skeith before converting the last invader,
as the enchantments will be carried forward to the next Battle/Mission and
you would have to waste a turn to break these enchantments in the new
Battle/Mission.
<br><br></td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><br><table width="80%" border="2"><tbody><tr><td><br><font size="5"></font><center><b>Mission 7</b></center>
<br><br><center><img src="./attack_pattern_files/m7.jpg" width="395" height="414"></center>
<br><br>
The strategy is similar to that for Mission 6 - move your Skeith, Scorchio,
Techo and Moehog to Row 6 and concentrate converting all the invader
Techos first. It is not necessary to get the Chainmails and Halberds
(if any) since their attack and defence bonuses should be less than those
that are already equipped by your fighters. You may want to equip your
Skeith with the Halberd so that it can have unlimited moves, but be aware
that the Halberd has 1 less attack bonus than the Berseker Battleaxe.
